# Recipes for AutoPKG

- This collection of recipes has been culled from various sources, most, if not all, of them can be found [here:](https://github.com/autopkg).

## I just modified these recipes to fit the naming convention that I like to use, so that after running autopkg, I can do less work, which is pretty much the point of AutoPKG, right?
